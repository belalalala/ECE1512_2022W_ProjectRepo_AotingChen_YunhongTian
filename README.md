# Project A: Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks
This project endeavors to generate explanation maps that interpret the behavior of two models trained on different datasets. The first model is a very shallow CNN trained on “MNIST-1D”, a small-scale dataset prepared for generic array classification. The second model is a VGG- 7 network trained on the “HMT” dataset utilized for histopathologic tissue classification. There are three methods used: SISE, SmoothGrad, IntegratedGrad
* For MNIST-1D dataset: run the  MNIST1D.ipynb with suporting .py files saved in supplementPY folder.
* For HMT dataset: run the HMT.ipynb with suporting .py files saved in both supplementPY folder (only InteGrad_model2 files) and HMT_py folder.
