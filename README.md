# Project A: Visual Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks
This project endeavors to generate explanation maps that interpret the behavior of two models trained on different datasets. The first model is a very shallow CNN trained on “MNIST-1D”, a small-scale dataset prepared for generic array classification. The second model is a VGG- 7 network trained on the “HMT” dataset utilized for histopathologic tissue classification.
  ## For MNIST-1D dataset:
